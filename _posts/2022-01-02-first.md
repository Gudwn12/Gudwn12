week2
This week I join the Korean league of legends community for the first time. I was really into this game however, I didn’t had that much friend to play. At the community I met a new friend who is currently attending in RMIT. We were talking about our major and he told me he used to major engineering in USA, therefore he thought me some basics of coding and he also gave me some tips in school such as, giving specific references and Korean website that I can find thesis for my assignment or research and it called DBpia. Before I never learned about coding or software but with his help I was able to make my github blog and improve my learning skills in this course. The next day I met him I had class so I had to go to Saigon south campus so my friend guide me a tour in campus we went to cafeteria , library and some place where I can fully concentrate on work. On Thursday class, we learned engagement and effective oral communication. In this topic other professor came to our class to teach us and I remember he was really passionate in teaching. The topic was about the report to presentation from the slide we were thought about the progress of the report to presentation. The one thing I remember clearly was the consider the audience and improving our slides. Before when I made power point I just tried hard to make my slide long. However, I learned I have to consider the audience and some tips to make ppt better such as making it concise and minimizing the bullet point. When I was in high school teacher gave us home work to do research and to present in front of class and that work I only cared about the length of my slides and it was pretty long nevertheless, my friend got lot higher score even with a smaller amount. After learning this course I knew it wasn’t about the length is more with the key points and interest to audience. By the end of the class we learned graph and process description. This was bit more easy for me because I learned some words for graph and whats the key point because I learned it when I was learning ielts. This topic was also helpful for me.

week3
On Tuesday in week3 I learned interest topic about doing a research I learned doing research before in previous unistart course, however in this course I felt like it was more like learning more skilled research than before. Me and classmates learned specific processes about research and examples about research related with technologies. One thing I remember clearly was the video about the ethics in doing the research and it was about the nazi during the world war 2 they did research that people are responsive to authority model and enable to separate their own responsibility to their action. The video was very interesting that the pressure makes them lose more responsibility. After this video we learned about planning the research. During the class professor asked us the recent experience of research and I thought of searching for crypto currency. I was curious how this currency works and made so I searched it on google how it works and I saw some youtube video but it was so confusing so I couldn’t understand. However, from now on I will be able to find more knowledges by using the skills and following the method I learned in class. Thursday class was about team work. All the class mates are Vietnamese and they were in same previous course so they knew each other but I was from another course therefore I wasn’t friends with anyone in class. Learning this topic made me having new friends. This topic we also thought about the next group assignment so we had to choose the topic and the other classmates came up with brilliant ideas that I wanted to do. From that point friends ask me for facebook friend request and we made group chat. I was so happy that day because it helped me a lot to make a new friends. Me and my classmates discussed which topic we are going to do and we came up with two topic one mechanical ”classical” weapons and metaverse. These two topic are so interesting and I had wo choose one and I felt more doing a research of weapons because the weapon topic is one of favorite topics to mans so I would be more in to this topic
