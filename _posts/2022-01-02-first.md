On Tuesday in week3 I learned interest topic about doing a research I learned doing research before in previous unistart course, however in this course I felt like it was more like learning more skilled research than before. Me and classmates learned specific processes about research and examples about research related with technologies. One thing I remember clearly was the video about the ethics in doing the research and it was about the nazi during the world war 2 they did research that people are responsive to authority model and enable to separate their own responsibility to their action. The video was very interesting that the pressure makes them lose more responsibility. After this video we learned about planning the research. During the class professor asked us the recent experience of research and I thought of searching for crypto currency. I was curious how this currency works and made so I searched it on google how it works and I saw some youtube video but it was so confusing so I couldn’t understand. However, from now on I will be able to find more knowledges by using the skills and following the method I learned in class. Thursday class was about team work. All the class mates are Vietnamese and they were in same previous course so they knew each other but I was from another course therefore I wasn’t friends with anyone in class. Learning this topic made me having new friends. This topic we also thought about the next group assignment so we had to choose the topic and the other classmates came up with brilliant ideas that I wanted to do. From that point friends ask me for facebook friend request and we made group chat. I was so happy that day because it helped me a lot to make a new friends. Me and my classmates discussed which topic we are going to do and we came up with two topic one mechanical ”classical” weapons and metaverse. These two topic are so interesting and I had wo choose one and I felt more doing a research of weapons because the weapon topic is one of favorite topics to mans so I would be more in to this topic
